# 🫁 Pneumonia Detection

Coursework project for the **"Deep Representations and Learning"** module, part of the MSc AI for Biomedicine and Healthcare programme.

---

## 📋 Project Overview

This project focuses on developing deep learning models to detect **pneumonia** from chest X-ray images using the [Chest X-Ray Images (Pneumonia) dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia/data) provided on Kaggle.

We will explore and analyze the dataset, build and evaluate convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and investigate model performance on classifying whether a chest X-ray shows signs of pneumonia.
